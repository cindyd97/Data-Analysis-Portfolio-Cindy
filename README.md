### Credit Score and Loan Prediction (Group Project)
Git Repo: [Credit Score and Loan Prediction](https://github.com/cindyd97/Credit-Score-Loan-Default-Prediction)

Description:
This group project involves creating a machine learning model that classifies a bank's customers based on their credit score and credit information. The group also created a machine learning model that predicts whether a client's loan application is default or not based on specific features related to their demographics, education, payment history, annual income data, etc. Banks and financial services institutions utilize credit score classification to assess a borrower's creditworthiness, enabling them to make calculated decisions about managing risk and profitability. There are 5 credit score brackets that a person can fall into, however, for simplicity purposes, our project will focus on 3 categories of credit which are Good, Standard, or Bad. Financial loan services are utilized by many companies, especially, in the financial services and banking industry. The goal of financial loan services is to mitigate the risk of default payments and ensure that clients are paying back their loans in compliance with their loan contract. Clients will either be deemed default (high risk) or not (low risk).

### Funding with Deep Learning
Git Repo: [Funding with Deep Learning](https://github.com/cindyd97/Funding_with-Deep-Learning)

Description:
The purpose of this analysis is to create a tool that will assist a nonprofit organization in selecting applicants for funding with the best chance of success. The tool is a binary classifier that can predict an applicantâ€™s success or not, if funded by the nonprofit organization. The label column is the column indicating if the applicant was successful or not, 'IS_SUCCESSFUL'. The remaining columns are features utilized in the model that would assist in the learning. They provide insight into the data for the model to learn how to predict new data. However, columns that serve the purpose of identification, should be removed as they donâ€™t serve a relevant purpose in the modelâ€™s learning.

The model utilizes â€˜reluâ€™ as the activation with the first hidden layer having 8 neurons and the second layer having 5 neurons. The output layer is expected to classify 2 classes with activation using â€˜sigmoidâ€™. The model is set to binary classification using â€˜adamâ€™ as optimizer and â€˜accuracy â€™ as metrics. The model was able to attain an accuracy score of 1 and a loss score of 0.5544 with 100 epochs. The model started with 2 layers each having 1 neuron. Neurons were incrementally increased after each run trial to find out how many neurons were needed to attain an accuracy score of 75% or more. It was concluded that 8 neurons in the first layer and 5 neurons in the second layer were acceptable in building the model.

Language:
Python (with Tensor Flow)
