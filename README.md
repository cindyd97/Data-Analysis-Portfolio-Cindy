## About ##

Hello, I'm Cindy! I have a background in Audit-Accounting and currently, I am on track to completing my Certificate in Data Analytics at University of California, Irvine. I have developed a strong foundation in Financial Audits in the financial services industry and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

In the past 6 months, I have dedicated time to expanding my expertise in data analytics where I am strengthening my skills in Python, SQL, data modeling, and data visualization (Tableau/Power BI). I am particularly interested in leveraging these skills to enhance data-driven insights in asset management, risk modeling, and financial performance analysis.
